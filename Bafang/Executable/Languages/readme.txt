DO NOT MODIFY OR DELETE existing files

You can define your own language for the software creating necessary files, based on existing subdirectories and files into this "Languages" directory
When adding a language file set, don't forget to declare it into the "languages.ini" file

Limitation:
You shall not use Quote ' or double quote " in languages files because they are not managed by the software and lead to exception error. 

Thanks to all contributors.
