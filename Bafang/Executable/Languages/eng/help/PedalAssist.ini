nbLine=1
line1=Should be kept as *DoubleSignal-24* for BBS0xxx
title=Pedal Type ?

[btnHelp_PA_DesignAssistLevel]
nbLine=2
line1=This setting if set will override the Limit Speed setting on the Basic Tab and also overrides the speed limited on the Basic Tab.
line2=Should be set to *By Display?s Command*
title=Designated Assist Level ?

[btnHelp_PA_SpeedLimit]
nbLine=3
line1=Cuts power when the road speed from the mag sensor hits the number set here. If set to By Display?s Command then it uses the Display?s set speed limit.
line2=
line3=Frequent setting is : *By Display?s Command*
title=Speed limited ?

[btnHelp_PA_StartCurrent]
nbLine=5
line1=BE CAREFULL !! This variable is vital for not killing the controller.
line2=The lower the Start Current is set the less power is directed to the PAS system upon startup, this will create less strain on the controller when starting from a standstill, especially if you are in a gear that is too high.
line3=100% Start Current will peak at well over 1kW draw. With Kepler?s settings this should be set to 30% or less. This can be set all the way down to 1, very useful for IGH bikes and for people wanting a more gentle start
line4=
line5=Frequent settings are from 10 to 50
title=Start Current ?

[btnHelp_PA_SlowStartMode]
nbLine=4
line1=Controls how quickly the power ramps and how much it overshoots. If this variable is set too high the PAS start will be jerky, if set too low you risk blowing the controller as with Start Current above.
line2=If you are in too low of a gear to start and this variable is set too low it can blow the controller.
line3=
line4=Frequent settings are from 3 to 6
title=Slow-start Mode ?


[btnHelp_PA_StartDegree]
nbLine=4
line1=The number of sensor steps before the start up commences. The maximum accepted is 20. 24 is a full pedal revolution. 
line2=Too few makes start-up occur with too slight a pedal movement. Lower number is less pedal movement to start the motor. Does not work properly with 1 or 0. 
line3=
line4=Frequent setting is 4
title=Startup Degree(Signal No.) ?


[btnHelp_PA_WorkMode]
nbLine=5
line1=Adjusts the amount of power that can be applied to each pedal rotation. 
line2=The higher the number the greater the power applied to each rotation. 
line3=This might affect at what rpm peak power sits in PAS operation, changing it doesn?t seem to be noticeable so we advise to leave it alone. 
line4=
line5=Frequent settings are Undeterminated or 10
title=Work Mode (Angular Speed of Pedal/wheel*10) ?

[btnHelp_PA_StopDelay]
nbLine=6
line1=This affects how quickly the drive stops after you stop pedaling. Some people report that setting this lower (as low as 5) may affect the startup delay on the throttle. 
line2=If you set it to 0 the PAS system ceases to work. 25 is probably too high. This setting disables the PAS if it is set less than 5. 
line3=I strongly recommend setting this to 5, especially if you want to use the PAS system without using ebrakes. 
line4=If you set this less than 10 on the v2 of the BBS02 controllers then your PAS will not work properly at all. On the older BBS02v1 controllers and the BBSHD controllers you can set this as low as 5 before you start having issues with the PAS. 
line5=
line6=Frequent settings are from 10 to 25
title=Stop delay (time of stop) ?

[btnHelp_PA_CurrentDecay]
nbLine=4
line1=Determines how high up the pedal cadence rpm range it starts to reduce power, 8 being the highest. There is no detail on actual rpm speeds for the Current Decay setting. 
line2=The lower this setting is the sooner the drive unit will start cutting back on the power as you pedal faster. 
line3=
line4=Frequent settings are from 4 to 8
title=Current Decay(1-8) ?

[btnHelp_PA_StopDecay]
nbLine=3
line1=The amount of time the system takes to cut after pedaling stops. Lower is faster. 
line2=
line3=Frequent settings are from 0 to 20
title=Stop Decay(x10ms) ?

[btnHelp_PA_KeepCurrent]
nbLine=4
line1= What this setting does when set at 60% is ramp the current down to 60% of the PAS level selected based on pedal cadence rpm, so at low pedal cadence you get 100% of the level selected but as your pedal cadence increases the power is reduced down to 60%. 
line2=As you pedal faster the motor does less work down to whatever this number is set to (60% of max current or 15 amps on 25 Amp system). 
line3=
line4=Frequent settings are from 10 to 50
title=Keep Current(%) ?
