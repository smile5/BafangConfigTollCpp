nbLine=5
line1=This the throttle input starting voltage, the point at which the controller responds to input is at 1.1 volts, so set value to 11 which = 1.1 volts.
line2=As you  to roll on the throttle the voltage moves up from zero and when it reaches 1.1v the motor s to turn.
line3=Best to leave between 10 and 15. Too low and the display will throw an error as the motor will want to run continuously. If you change the throttle you will need to find the new lowest setting.
line4=
line5=Standard setting : 11
title=Start Voltage(x100mv) ?

[btnHelp_Throttle_EndVolt]
nbLine=5
line1=You can set the max range to 42 which is the max input the controller accepts from throttle input 4.2v. If you set lower than this value your throttle response is not as linear or smooth as it could be.
line2=A suggestion you set start voltage to 11 and end voltage to 42 for a wider range of throttle response and smoother control of motor output.
line3=If you use an aftermarket throttle you will need to test to see what voltage the hall sensor throttle is giving off at full throttle and set this number slightly lower than that voltage shown on the meter (times 10).
line4=
line5=Standard setting : 35
title=End Voltage(x100mv) ?

[btnHelp_Throttle_Mode]
nbLine=5
line1=Switching this to Current Mode (instead of Speed mode) has an improvement in the throttle response smoothness.
line2=If you change this then set the Start Current % on this page to 10 or less.
line3=Some users of the newer BBS02?s say that the CURRENT setting can cause jerkyness with the throttle, in which case you should set it to SPEED mode.
line4=
line5=Standard setting : Current
title=Mode ?

[btnHelp_Throttle_DesignAssistLevel]
nbLine=6
line1=If you disable the PAS system then this will give you the same number of levels of throttle power as PAS settings. If you don?t disable the PAS system then you should probably set this to 9.
line2=If your bike is in a rental fleet and don?t want to deal with fried controllers then you should set it to something much lower like 6.
line3=This setting if set will override the Limit Speed setting on the Basic Tab and also overrides the speed limited on the Basic Tab.
line4=If you set this to 9 be aware that you can and will fry your controller if you are in too high of a gear on too steep of a hill and you peg the throttle.
line5=
line6=Standard setting : 9
title=Designated Assist ?

[btnHelp_Throttle_SpeedLimit]
nbLine=7
line1=Cuts power when the road speed from the mag sensor hits the number set here. If set to By Display?s Command then it uses the Display?s set speed limit.
line2=However this setting can sometimes cause severe Throttle lag in PAS0 so if you set it to 40km/hr the 2-3 second throttle lag should disappear.
line3=The speed limit only applies to the PAS and in ignored by throttle input, so in other words, if you want to go past the speed limit, just use the throttle.
line4=This is a setting that allows the rider to set a pace or cadence when using pedal assist for a comfortable steady pace.  
line5=Almost like cruise control, when you  to go past the speed, the motor cuts out to maintain a lower speed.  It is a useful way to extend range. The max speed limit of the display is 45 mph.
line6=
line7=Frequent setting : 40km/h
title=Speed Limited ?

[btnHelp_Throttle_StartCurrent]
nbLine=6
line1=Percentage current of available when throttle initially applied. Unwise to raise beyond 20, but fine to lower, however motor will give less power when the throttle is engaged.
line2=If you set the throttle Mode to Current (which I think you should) you will want to lower this number substantially or it will be very jerky on startup.
line3=5-10 gives a much smoother startup. This can be set all the way down to 1, great for IGH bikes and smoothing out power delivery.
line4=It is highly recommended to keep this parameter low (10 is safe)otherwise the throttle is far too jerky and wheelie prone. If you want max power and torque then set the Throttle Handle to Speed Mode.
line5=
line6=Frequent setting : 10 to 20
