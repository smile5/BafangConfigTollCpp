nbLine=4
line1=This number will change based on the pack size and configuration.  
line2=Most likely your battery will have a BMS that will shut off power when it gets too low. This setting is mostly useful when you are running a battery setup without a BMS which is not advised. 
line3=
line4=For a 48V pack this value should not be lower than 38V

[btnHelp_Basic_CurrentLimit]
nbLine=5
line1=This sets the power level that the drive unit will pull from the battery pack. Be aware that just because it is set lower, does not mean that it will not draw more amps for brief periods.  
line2=If you don?t want to stress the BMS you may want to set this number lower than you think it should be by 2-3 amps then slowly increase it over time if your $15 watt meter shows that it is not pulling too much power on a regular basis. 
line3=This variable will be set lower than 25 if you have a BBS01 or a BBS02 with a lower power level rating than 750W 
line4=If this is set lower than 25 from the factory you CANNOT RAISE it safely unless you are sure it is a 750 Watt unit & controller and your battery can handle the draw (it should say on the bottom of the unit). 
line5=If you have a BBSHD make sure that this is set to 30 and no lower.

line1=Assist levels are le PAS level (level of assistance) you select during biking. Assist 0 means No Assistance.
line2=The number of PAS available on your bike depends on your display configuration. See the Infos tab

[btnHelp_Basic_LvlCurrentLimit]
nbLine=2
line1=This is the % limitation of the max amperage configured. 
line2=on more recent controllers, if set to 0 for PAS 0, the throttle might not work unless this is set to 1 . You must set limit speed to 1 as well as well as setting the Designated Assist to 9 on the throttle page.
title=Current limit % ?

[btnHelp_Basic_SpeedLimit]
nbLine=1
line1=Speed limiting is done based on motor RPMs not road speed. The throttle might not work in PAS 0 unless this is set to at least 1, it is really nice to have a hand throttle setting without any PAS intervention.
